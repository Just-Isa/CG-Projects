## Running Instructions

1. Navigate into the ./Deboor folder
2. Run python .\deBoor.py
3. Start drawing points on the window that popped up (atleast 4) to start generating splines

Examples:
    
    Example command for Squirrel: python .\RayTracer.py 200 200 -mp 4
    Example command for Cow: python .\pointViewerTemplate.py bunny.obj

- Change point-weight:   

        - Hold shift, and click on (self chosen) Point, then while still holding hover above and below the point 

- Change amount of Points on Curve:

       - m for less points

       - shift+m for more points

- Change degree of points:   

        - k for smaller degree
        - shift k for higher degree

- Clear the scene:
        
        - c

---

## Points all start with a degree of 1
